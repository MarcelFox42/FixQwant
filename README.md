# FixQwant
A Firefox Addon to fix the horrible new design on Qwant Lite.

This is about as much effort as I am willing to put in for this Addon. :b
It's small, and not a signed Firefox Addon. For this addon to work you'll have to install it temporarily, which means, that its "uninstalled" every time you close Firefox.

=== How to Install ===
1. Download the fixQwant directory 
2. Type about:debugging into the address bar and press enter
3. Click on "This Firefox" on the left side of the browser window
4. Click on the Button "Load Temporary Add-on..."
5. Select and open the manifest.json file in the fixQwant directory
6. The addon should be installed.

Try it out on Qwant Lite:
https://lite.qwant.com/?theme=1

Qwant Lite should show a dark grey background and a dark blue shadow on the text input field

If the addon doesnt work try this:
1. Type about:addons into the address bar and press enter
2. Click on the FixQwant addon
3. Click on "Allow" to Run this addon in private windows
4. Try it again on Qwant Lite
